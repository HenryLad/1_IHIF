## Going for Gold
This C# program is designed to simulate a game scenario where a player collects various types of ore and receives gold based on a set of rules. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

    User Input:
    The program starts by welcoming the player to the "going for gold mission" and prompts them to enter the amount of ore they currently possess.

    csharp

Console.WriteLine("Welcome to the going for gold mission");
Console.WriteLine("Please enter your ore number");
int ore = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()!);

The player's input, representing the quantity of ore, is stored in the variable ore.

Gold Calculation:
The program then initializes a variable gold to keep track of the total gold the player will receive. The gold calculation is based on specific rules for different ranges of ore quantities.

csharp

int gold = 0;

gold += Math.Min(ore, 10) * 10;
ore -= Math.Min(ore, 10);

gold += Math.Min(ore, 5) * 5;
ore -= Math.Min(ore, 5);

gold += Math.Min(ore, 3) * 2;
ore -= Math.Min(ore, 3);

gold += ore * 1;
ore -= ore;

    The player receives 10 gold for each of the first 10 units of ore.
    The next 5 units of ore yield 5 gold each.
    The following 3 units of ore result in 2 gold each.
    Any remaining ore contributes 1 gold per unit.

The calculations are performed using Math.Min to ensure that the program doesn't exceed the specified limits for each category of ore.

Output:
Finally, the program prints out the total amount of gold the player has earned.

csharp

    Console.WriteLine("You now have: " + gold + "");

    This line outputs a message indicating the total amount of gold the player has earned based on their input.

In summary, the code represents a basic game mechanic where players input their ore quantity, and the program calculates their corresponding gold earnings according to predefined rules.
