## Switch Exersice Calulator

Here's the detailed Explenation

    User Input:
        The program prompts the user to enter an operator (+, -, *, /, %).
        It then asks for the first and second numbers.

    Calculation using Switch Statement:
        The code uses a switch statement to determine which operation to perform based on the entered operator.
        If the operator is +, it adds the two numbers.
        If the operator is -, it subtracts the second number from the first.
        If the operator is *, it multiplies the two numbers.
        If the operator is /, it checks if the second number is not zero before performing division.
        If the operator is %, it checks if the second number is not zero before performing the modulo operation.
        If none of the recognized operators is entered, it displays an error message.

    Output:
        The result of the calculation is then printed to the console.

In summary, this code creates a basic calculator that supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, division (with error checking for division by zero), and modulo operations.
