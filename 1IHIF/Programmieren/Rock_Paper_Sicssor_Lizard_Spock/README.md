## Rock Paper Sicssor Lizard Spock 

Let's break down this code in more detail:

```csharp

const int Rock = 1;
const int Paper = 2;
const int Scissors = 3;
const int Lizard = 4;
const int Spock = 5;

const int Draw = 0;
const int Player1Win = 1;
const int Player2Win = 2;
```
Here, integer constants are defined to represent the choices in the game. Each choice is assigned a unique integer value. Additionally, constants for the game outcomes are defined: Draw for a tie, Player1Win for Player 1 winning, and Player2Win for Player 2 winning.

```csharp

Console.Write("Player 1, choose 1 Rock, 2 Paper, 3 Scissors, 4 Lizard, 5 Spock: ");
int player1 = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()!);
Console.Clear();
Console.Write("Player 2, choose 1 Rock, 2 Paper, 3 Scissors, 4 Lizard, 5 Spock: ");
int player2 = int.Parse(Console.ReadLine()!);
```
The program prompts each player to input their choice by displaying the options and reading the input as an integer.

```csharp

int winner = Draw;
```
A variable winner is initialized with the default value Draw, indicating that the game starts with no winner.

```csharp

switch (player1)
{
    // Switch based on Player 1's choice
    case Rock:
        switch (player2)
        {
            // Nested switch based on Player 2's choice when Player 1 chose Rock
            case Scissors:
            case Lizard:
                winner = Player1Win;
                break;
            case Paper:
            case Spock:
                winner = Player2Win;
                break;
            default:
                winner = Draw;
                break;
        }
        break;

    // Similar switch cases for Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock follow...
}

// If none of the cases match, winner remains as Draw.
```
Nested switch statements are used to determine the winner based on the choices made by each player. The logic follows the rules of the game:

    If Player 1 chooses Rock, they win against Scissors and Lizard but lose to Paper and Spock.
    Similar logic is applied for Paper, Scissors, Lizard, and Spock.

```csharp

Console.WriteLine("The winner is Player " + winner);

```

Finally, the program prints the result to the console, indicating which player (if any) is the winner or if it's a draw.

In summary, this code implements a console-based version of the "Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock" game, taking input from two players and determining the winner based on the rules of the game.
