## Calculator
This C# code is a simple console application that takes two operands and an operator as input from the user and performs a basic mathematical operation on them (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division). It then displays the result to the console.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the code:

    The program starts by displaying prompts to the user to enter two numeric operands and an operator.

    Console.Write("Enter first operand: ");: This line prompts the user to enter the first operand and displays the text.

    double firstNumber = double.Parse(Console.ReadLine()!);: It reads the user's input from the console and parses it as a double (floating-point number). The ! after Console.ReadLine() is used to indicate that the value should not be null, assuming that the user will enter a valid number. If the input is not a valid double, it will throw an exception.

    The program repeats the same steps for the second operand and operator.

    The code uses a switch statement to perform the operation based on the entered operator:
        If the operator is +, it performs addition and displays the result.
        If the operator is -, it performs subtraction and displays the result.
        If the operator is *, it performs multiplication and displays the result.
        If the operator is /, it performs division. It also checks if the second operand is not equal to zero to avoid dividing by zero, which would result in an exception. If the second operand is not zero, it displays the result; otherwise, it informs the user that division by zero is not allowed.
        If the entered operator is anything other than these four (+, -, *, /), it displays a message indicating that it's an unknown operator.

    The results are displayed with a specific format using the F2 format specifier to show two decimal places.

In summary, this code is a basic calculator that takes user input for two operands and an operator, performs the requested operation, and then displays the result. It includes error handling to prevent division by zero and handles unknown operators gracefully.
